## How it works
1. Start the software. By default, NinBuddy will start when your Pi boots.
2. Plug in an Xbox or PlayStation controller to your Raspberry Pi via USB.
3. Go to `Change Grip/Order` on your Nintendo Switch.
4. Wait for the controller to connect, and play!

**Connected to Wi-Fi?** NinBuddy shows a URL in the terminal. Visit this on your mobile device to play!

<br />

## Core Features
- Use an Xbox & PlayStation controller on your Nintendo Switch, without needing a PC or internet connection
- Use your mobile phone's web browser as a game controller
  - NinBuddy automatically starts a web server, which you can connect to from your mobile device & use an on-screen controller
  - Presses are registered in zones rather than on the exact buttons/joysticks, allowing for a decent gameplay experience
- NinBuddy can be configured to automatically start on boot
  - Turn on your Raspberry Pi on-the-go, plug in a controller via USB and you'll automatically be connected to your nearby Switch!
- Play pass-to-play games more easily with mobile
  - While NinBuddy can only act as 1 game controller, multiple phones can control your game simultaneously
