- Use your mobile phone's web browser as a game controller

  - Presses are registered in zones rather than on the exact buttons/joysticks, allowing for a decent gameplay experience
- NinBuddy can be configured to automatically start on boot
  - Turn on your Raspberry Pi on-the-go, plug in a controller via USB and you'll automatically be connected to your nearby Switch!
